## HOW TO WORK ##

Call /api/API, the first get method should return the data.

## Thinking process ## 

Fist I started at getting the ids from the best 20.

After that, proceed to pick the values from the best 20 posts.

With that data, I proceed to 'beutify' the string json to thet way it should be.

Then, with everything in place, returned the JSON Object.

After that, it was possible to proceed with the unit testing.
